# Disease-Prediction-Project

Problem Statement :- The rapid and accurate detection of diseases is crucial for timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to predict diseases based on symptoms provided in a dataset. The primary objective is to design a model that can assist healthcare professionals and patients by offering preliminary diagnostics based on input symptoms.

Methodology :- The methodology involves preprocessing a dataset of symptoms and associated diseases, feature selection, and applying supervised learning algorithms. Various machine learning models, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, were trained and evaluated for accuracy, precision, and recall. Cross-validation techniques ensured robustness and reliability of the predictions.

Key :- Key results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high accuracy in predicting diseases across a diverse set of symptoms, outperforming baseline methods. The findings suggest that such systems can act as a supplementary tool for healthcare professionals, enabling faster diagnostic decisions while reducing the dependency on manual processes.

In conclusion, the project underscores the potential of machine learning in augmenting disease detection. Future work could involve incorporating real-time data from electronic health records (EHRs) and expanding the dataset to include rare diseases for broader applicability.
